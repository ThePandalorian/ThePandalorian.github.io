Did not go sampling today as my guide, Mr. Atulie, did not show up due to some preoccupations. This gave me some time to slump up in bed and work on this site. I also spent an hour or so reading. I'm currently reading Temsula Ao's "Aoesenla's Story". In the evening Mr. Hiekha invited Jeevan and me over for dinner. For dinner we had perfectly cooked pork with boiled vegetables, local rice and akhuni. Mr. Hiekha was busy entertaining some other guest in the common room the whole time so we didn't get a chance to eat together.
