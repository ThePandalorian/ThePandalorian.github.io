# Pretty quotes
<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
As you could perhaps guess from the epigraph on my homepage, I like quotes. Here's a small collection I've built up so far (Excluding some of the more well-known ones, like the Darwin quote that everyone likes). Of course, just because I've included a quote doesn't mean I completely agree with everything it says or implies, it just means I liked the quote. You can also find a list of quotes on <a href='https://allisonkshaw.weebly.com/theory.html'>Allison Shaw's website</a>.

<div style="text-align: center">“A good theoretical model of a complex system should be like a good caricature: it should emphasize those features which are most important and should downplay the inessential details. Now the only snag with this advice is that one does not really know which are the inessential details until one has understood the phenomena under study. Consequently, one should investigate a wide range of models and not stake one’s life (or one’s theoretical insight) on one particular model only”</div>

However, calling them laws is to give them an epistemological status that they do not deserve. Quite simply, the “Laws” are not strict enough to judge if a species has broken a law; in its defence the species can simply suggest that the law should be re-interpreted.”</div>
