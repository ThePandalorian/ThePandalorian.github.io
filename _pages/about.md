<h2> <b> Hi there! </b> </h2>
<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm Taksh, a Masters student at the <a href='https://www.ncbs.res.in/'>National Centre for Biological Sciences</a> in Bengaluru, India. I am broadly interested in the evolution of vocal learning in organisms.<br>
<br>
Currently I am working on my Masters thesis where I'm trying to understand how geographical barriers help shape the patterns that we see in vocally learnt elements in bird songs. For this I'm visiting the states of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Mizoram, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh in the North Eastern Region of India. 
<br>
<br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to  music and lots of strong coffee. I'm particularly fond of history and historical fiction, and you can find a list of books I liked over on the <a href='Books'>Books</a> page. This website is a work in progress and I will be fine tuning it over time.
