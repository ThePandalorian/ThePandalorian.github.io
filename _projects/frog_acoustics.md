Do frogs use different types of vocal sequences in different contexts? If so, how may sequence structure vary with social context? I spent the monsoon of 2019 recording vocalizations of <i>Nyctibatrachus humayuni</i>, a frog with a simple two-note repertoire, and the monsoon of 2020 recording the vocalizations of <i>Pseudophilautus amboli</i>, a frog with a complex six-note repertoire, to try to answer these questions. This work was conducted as two summer projects in
 <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/eceb-lab/home">Dr. Anand Krishnan's lab</a> at IISER Pune and in collaboration with <a href = "http://seshadriks.weebly.com/">Dr. Seshadri K.S.</a>, a postdoc in <a href = "https://mariathaker.weebly.com/">Dr. Maria Thakerâ€™s lab</a> at IISc. We uncovered evidence that anurans change vocal sequence structure based on behavioral context, and do so in diverse ways.

Male <i>P. amboli</i> use different note types based on whether they are vocalizing alone (top) or engaged in territorial disputes (bottom). Co-occurrence analysis of note types (right) is a new tool that can be used to look for sequence structure without assumptions of Markovianity. Here, the high reds on the diagonal in the bottom right figure indicate that males typically use highly repetitive note sequences in territorial disputes.

As part of this project, I developed a novel computational technique for analyzing vocal sequence that has since found more general applications in describing and studying the syntactic structure of animal vocalizations (<a href = 'https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.25.497582'>Jagan <i>et al.</i> 2022</a>). This technique, which we call `co-occurrence analysis', is a more robust alternative to the common technique of obtaining transition probability matrices to describe vocal sequence structure by assuming the underlying processes are low-order Markovian (an assumption that we know is often not justified). The findings of these two years have now been published as a in <i>Animal Behaviour</i> (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2021.12.004'>Bhat <i>et al.</i> 2022</a>). You can listen to me give a quick ten minute talk on the topic here:
